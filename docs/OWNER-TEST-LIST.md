# Owner test list (things only James at the console can check)

Kept current by the agents; newest additions at the bottom of each section. Lab copy = `C:\Users\james\i76-uncap-lab\game-dd-20261003`.
Daily driver = `C:\Users\james\Games\Interstate76-2026-10-03`. Audio may be muted by the agents: `i76-uncap-lab\tools\mute.ps1 -Off`.

## Daily driver (already promoted, confirm in normal play)

1. **Mouse in widescreen (promotion 15, 2026-10-08).** `PLAY.bat`. Main menu, TRIP / LOAD BOOKMARK, garage Build & Repair:
   DONE with no engine -> the "CAN'T GET VERY FAR" popup: a small arrow should follow your hand over the frozen picture; OK closes it
   (click, Enter or Space). Save Bookmark screen: overwrite prompt Y/N. In a mission: Esc menu items and Exit. Same with `PLAY-balanced.bat`.
   Anything odd -> rollback is `_rollback\15` (five files).
2. **Force feedback after promotion 15.** The gate had no wheel plugged in. Plug the wheel in before `PLAY.bat` and confirm FFB feels as before.

## Lab copy (candidates, not in the daily driver)

3. **Collision fix A/B.** `TEST-coll-A-control.bat` (= your PLAY.bat) vs `TEST-coll-B-window2.bat` (I76_COLL_WINDOW=2 + dedupe).
   T05 (Taurus jump mission) roadblocks, cars, buildings: does B hit what A drives through? Anything new and wrong in B (snagging on
   scenery, odd bumps, getting stuck, doubled crash sounds)? `TEST-coll-C-24fps.bat` = 24 fps reference (choppy on purpose; stock-like collisions).
   Measured offline: barricades contacted 36/36 with B vs 8/28 with A.
4. **Terrain drop-out watch.** `TEST-terrain-watch.bat` = PLAY.bat + drop detector. Play where you saw it (open desert, road bend). If the
   ground vanishes, note the time; the log (`Interstate 76\mciproxy.log`, lines `TERRAIN-DROP`) and a saved frame tell us the rest.
   Expected: never (the lab copy lacked I76_CAM_GROUND_FIX when you saw it; your driver has it).
5. **`PLAY-stock.bat` textures (daily driver).** Flagged 2026-10-10 by the preset-sync agent: it runs preset `stock` (no
   I76_ZGLIDE_TMUFIX) on `dgVoodoo.16x10.conf`, which has MemorySizeOfTMU 8192 since promotion 11; 4096+ without TMUFIX gave
   "texture exchange issues" in promotion 5R. Launch it briefly: wrong / swapped textures on terrain or cars = confirmed (fix: give
   PLAY-stock its own conf at 2048, a small promotion). Low priority if you never use PLAY-stock.
6. **Haptics telemetry v3 (sound / damage events), not installed yet.** Built 2026-10-10 as `music-fix\out\Strlkup-tel3.dll`
   (static-verified only). A console agent installs it in the lab copy first (keep the old `Strlkup.dll` beside it), then runs it with
   `I76_TELEMETRY=1 I76_SOUND_EVENTS=1 I76_DAMAGE_EVENTS=1 I76MUSIC_LOG=1` and `python tools\telemetry\i76tel.py --check` alongside.
   Pass: `mciproxy.log` shows `telemetry: on ... 4/4 event hooks`, `sound-events: on - stop taps 4/4 ... start tap on ... weapon-UI clicks 3/3`
   and `damage-events: on`; the listener prints one `SOUND+` per sound you hear (own guns `PLAYER`, an AI car's `other` with a position),
   a `SOUND-` when a skid ends, `WEAPON-UI cycle/link/unlink` on those keys, and `DAMAGE` with the side you were hit on (rammed from the
   left = `side left`). Anything wrong in the game itself (missing or doubled sounds, stutter, a crash) = fail; revert to the old DLL.
7. **HD sound pack A/B (`tools/soundhd`, pack v1, NOT installed anywhere yet).** An agent installs it into the lab copy first
   (`soundhd.py install --game <lab copy>` dry run, then `--apply`; it refuses anything outside `i76-uncap-lab\game*`, never overwrites
   your ADDON mods, and `uninstall --apply` removes exactly its 123 `.gpw`). Step 1 is the loader proof: blow up a car, and the
   explosion should play from the pack (16-bit 22 kHz). If it sounds exactly like stock, say so: that means loose ADDON `.gpw` are ignored.
   Then A/B the same mission with the pack on and off (t01 or t04), on the speakers you normally play on:
   - Ram cars and buildings at speed: the hit has weight (a low drop under it) but is **not louder** than stock. Any pumping or crunch?
   - Fire the MGs (hold the trigger), a cannon and rockets: a thump per shot, and the MG loop stays seamless (no tick, no drone).
   - Idle, then rev to the limiter: more body at idle; listen for flutter or a tick at the loop point and anything odd at high rpm.
   - Ignition, healthy and damaged: the low end on the engine catching, not on the cranking.
   - Horns and sirens: fuller, not distorted (these are the most limited files).
   - Skids, gravel, CB voices, menu sounds: should be **unchanged**.
   - Eyes closed: is the balance of CB vs engine vs weapons the same as stock?
   Report per sound if you can (the names are in `tools\soundhd\out\pack-v1\report\index.html`, with a spectrogram for each).
   Transducer stem test (later, once the haptics host plays `pack-v1\lfe\` on SOUND_START): your own hits heavy, AI hits lighter,
   engine rumble follows the revs, and nothing felt late compared with the sound.

## Haptics host (tools/haptics, Phase C of docs/HAPTICS-ARCHITECTURE.md; lab copy, A/A before A/B, report n)

8. **Record a real telemetry session.** Lab game with `I76_TELEMETRY=1 I76_SOUND_EVENTS=1 I76_DAMAGE_EVENTS=1`; in a console
   `tools\haptics\haptics.ps1 record --udp --out tools\haptics\replays\t01-c1.i76rec --seconds 300`; drive t01, shoot, hit a wall,
   jump, get shot. Then `haptics.ps1 decode <file> --events`. Expected: v3 frames; SOUND_START is_player 1 for your weapons, 0 for an
   AI car's; DAMAGE_SIDE on hits. The file replaces the scripted session as every offline test's input - keep it.
9. **Wheel + pad + shakers together.** `haptics.ps1 live --source udp` (files only) for one drive, then the same with `--live` and all
   three devices connected. Only question: interference or dropouts (feel comes later).
10. **Latency.** `--live --record` run: fire one shot, ram one wall, phone microphone on the shaker; event frame vs shaker onset.
11. **Wheel coexistence.** Host holding the wheel (`--live`), pull the trigger: does the game's own FFB still play anything?
12. **Hardpoint +0x10.** Same weapon aimed two ways with `tools\ffb\ffb-watch-effects.ps1`: firing frequency or direction?
13. **Explosion reach.** An AI car explodes nearby: EXPLOSION distance vs any concussion kick; sets `explosion.blast` reach_m.
14. **Effects one at a time.** `haptics.ps1 preview --effect <id> --live --sinks pad,lfe` for impact.collision, landing,
    weapon.fire, slip.grip_limit: does each read as what it is? (Devices move: owner present.)
15. **Feel session.** `python tools\haptics\design\report.py` open on a second screen; edit one effects\*.json at a time while
    `haptics.ps1 live --live` runs (hot reload), two laps per change.

## Fresh install (installer; blocks v1.1.0, backlog R-04)

16. **Fresh folder -> PLAY-i76.bat -> trip route.** Offline half done 2026-10-10 (docs\records\FRESH-INSTALL-CHECK-2026-10-10.md:
    six scratch installs, every file and md5 as expected, game never started). At the console (not over Remote Desktop: the setup
    sizes dgVoodoo to the display it sees), with no `C:\GOG Games\Interstate 76` yet: double-click `INSTALL.bat` (one UAC prompt for
    GOG's installer; it also installs the Nitro Pack into `C:\GOG Games\Interstate 76 Nitro Pack` unless run as
    `INSTALL.bat -SkipNitro`). Then the desktop shortcut / `PLAY-i76.bat` (preset best-120 on GOG 2.1.0.17's exe `9a232dcc`, which no
    preset has run on): PLEASE STAND BY, Esc past the intro, no dgVoodoo watermark or 4:3 picture; main menu pointer lands where you
    point; TRIP -> garage -> DONE with no engine -> the popup closes with a click; LOAD BOOKMARK any of the repo bookmarks
    -> in the mission: smooth 120, music playing, no flips on bumps; Esc -> Save Bookmark -> overwrite prompt Y/N -> back to the
    menu. Afterwards `mciproxy.log` in the game folder should list the switches as applied, not skipped. Optional: the same with
    `-Preset best-wide` (`PLAY-i76.bat`, `PLAY-balanced.bat`, `PLAY-16x10.bat`). Fail = skipped patches, a watermark, the mouse off in
    the menus, or no music; `install.ps1 -GameDir "C:\GOG Games\Interstate 76" -Preset stock` is the way back.
