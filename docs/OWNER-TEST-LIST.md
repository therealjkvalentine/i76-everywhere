# Owner test list (things only James at the console can check)

Kept current by the agents; newest additions at the bottom of each section. Lab copy = `C:\Users\james\i76-uncap-lab\game-dd-20261003`.
Daily driver = `C:\Users\james\Games\Interstate76-2026-10-03`. Audio may be muted by the agents: `i76-uncap-lab\tools\mute.ps1 -Off`.

## Daily driver (already promoted, confirm in normal play)

1. **Mouse in widescreen (promotion 15, 2026-10-08).** `PLAY.bat`. Main menu, TRIP / LOAD BOOKMARK, garage Build & Repair:
   DONE with no engine -> the "CAN'T GET VERY FAR" popup: a small arrow should follow your hand over the frozen picture; OK closes it
   (click, Enter or Space). Save Bookmark screen: overwrite prompt Y/N. In a mission: Esc menu items and Exit. Same with `PLAY-balanced.bat`.
   Anything odd -> rollback is `_rollback\15` (five files).
2. **Force feedback after promotion 15.** The gate had no wheel plugged in. Plug the wheel in before `PLAY.bat` and confirm FFB feels as before.

## Lab copy (candidates, not in the daily driver)

3. **Collision fix A/B.** `TEST-coll-A-control.bat` (= your PLAY.bat) vs `TEST-coll-B-window2.bat` (I76_COLL_WINDOW=2 + dedupe).
   T05 (Taurus jump mission) roadblocks, cars, buildings: does B hit what A drives through? Anything new and wrong in B (snagging on
   scenery, odd bumps, getting stuck, doubled crash sounds)? `TEST-coll-C-24fps.bat` = 24 fps reference (choppy on purpose; stock-like collisions).
   Measured offline: barricades contacted 36/36 with B vs 8/28 with A.
4. **Terrain drop-out watch.** `TEST-terrain-watch.bat` = PLAY.bat + drop detector. Play where you saw it (open desert, road bend). If the
   ground vanishes, note the time; the log (`Interstate 76\mciproxy.log`, lines `TERRAIN-DROP`) and a saved frame tell us the rest.
   Expected: never (the lab copy lacked I76_CAM_GROUND_FIX when you saw it; your driver has it).
5. **HD sound pack A/B (`tools/soundhd`, pack v1, NOT installed anywhere yet).** An agent installs it into the lab copy first
   (`soundhd.py install --game <lab copy>` dry run, then `--apply`; it refuses anything outside `i76-uncap-lab\game*`, never overwrites
   your ADDON mods, and `uninstall --apply` removes exactly its 123 `.gpw`). Step 1 is the loader proof: blow up a car, and the
   explosion should play from the pack (16-bit 22 kHz). If it sounds exactly like stock, say so: that means loose ADDON `.gpw` are ignored.
   Then A/B the same mission with the pack on and off (t01 or t04), on the speakers you normally play on:
   - Ram cars and buildings at speed: the hit has weight (a low drop under it) but is **not louder** than stock. Any pumping or crunch?
   - Fire the MGs (hold the trigger), a cannon and rockets: a thump per shot, and the MG loop stays seamless (no tick, no drone).
   - Idle, then rev to the limiter: more body at idle; listen for flutter or a tick at the loop point and anything odd at high rpm.
   - Ignition, healthy and damaged: the low end on the engine catching, not on the cranking.
   - Horns and sirens: fuller, not distorted (these are the most limited files).
   - Skids, gravel, CB voices, menu sounds: should be **unchanged**.
   - Eyes closed: is the balance of CB vs engine vs weapons the same as stock?
   Report per sound if you can (the names are in `tools\soundhd\out\pack-v1\report\index.html`, with a spectrogram for each).
   Transducer stem test (later, once the haptics host plays `pack-v1\lfe\` on SOUND_START): your own hits heavy, AI hits lighter,
   engine rumble follows the revs, and nothing felt late compared with the sound.
