# Owner test list (things only James at the console can check)

Kept current by the agents; newest additions at the bottom of each section. Lab copy = `C:\Users\james\i76-uncap-lab\game-dd-20261003`.
Daily driver = `C:\Users\james\Games\Interstate76-2026-10-03`. Audio may be muted by the agents: `i76-uncap-lab\tools\mute.ps1 -Off`.

## Daily driver (already promoted, confirm in normal play)

1. **Mouse in widescreen (promotion 15, 2026-10-08).** `PLAY.bat`. Main menu, TRIP / LOAD BOOKMARK, garage Build & Repair:
   DONE with no engine -> the "CAN'T GET VERY FAR" popup: a small arrow should follow your hand over the frozen picture; OK closes it
   (click, Enter or Space). Save Bookmark screen: overwrite prompt Y/N. In a mission: Esc menu items and Exit. Same with `PLAY-balanced.bat`.
   Anything odd -> rollback is `_rollback\15` (five files).
2. **Force feedback after promotion 15.** The gate had no wheel plugged in. Plug the wheel in before `PLAY.bat` and confirm FFB feels as before.

## Lab copy (candidates, not in the daily driver)

3. **Collision fix A/B.** `TEST-coll-A-control.bat` (= your PLAY.bat) vs `TEST-coll-B-window2.bat` (I76_COLL_WINDOW=2 + dedupe).
   T05 (Taurus jump mission) roadblocks, cars, buildings: does B hit what A drives through? Anything new and wrong in B (snagging on
   scenery, odd bumps, getting stuck, doubled crash sounds)? `TEST-coll-C-24fps.bat` = 24 fps reference (choppy on purpose; stock-like collisions).
   Measured offline: barricades contacted 36/36 with B vs 8/28 with A.
4. **Terrain drop-out watch.** `TEST-terrain-watch.bat` = PLAY.bat + drop detector. Play where you saw it (open desert, road bend). If the
   ground vanishes, note the time; the log (`Interstate 76\mciproxy.log`, lines `TERRAIN-DROP`) and a saved frame tell us the rest.
   Expected: never (the lab copy lacked I76_CAM_GROUND_FIX when you saw it; your driver has it).

## Haptics host (tools/haptics, Phase C of docs/HAPTICS-ARCHITECTURE.md; lab copy, A/A before A/B, report n)

5. **Record a real telemetry session.** Lab game with `I76_TELEMETRY=1 I76_SOUND_EVENTS=1 I76_DAMAGE_EVENTS=1`; in a console
   `tools\haptics\haptics.ps1 record --udp --out tools\haptics\replays\t01-c1.i76rec --seconds 300`; drive t01, shoot, hit a wall,
   jump, get shot. Then `haptics.ps1 decode <file> --events`. Expected: v3 frames; SOUND_START is_player 1 for your weapons, 0 for an
   AI car's; DAMAGE_SIDE on hits. The file replaces the scripted session as every offline test's input - keep it.
6. **Wheel + pad + shakers together.** `haptics.ps1 live --source udp` (files only) for one drive, then the same with `--live` and all
   three devices connected. Only question: interference or dropouts (feel comes later).
7. **Latency.** `--live --record` run: fire one shot, ram one wall, phone microphone on the shaker; event frame vs shaker onset.
8. **Wheel coexistence.** Host holding the wheel (`--live`), pull the trigger: does the game's own FFB still play anything?
9. **Hardpoint +0x10.** Same weapon aimed two ways with `tools\ffb\ffb-watch-effects.ps1`: firing frequency or direction?
10. **Explosion reach.** An AI car explodes nearby: EXPLOSION distance vs any concussion kick; sets `explosion.blast` reach_m.
11. **Effects one at a time.** `haptics.ps1 preview --effect <id> --live --sinks pad,lfe` for impact.collision, landing,
    weapon.fire, slip.grip_limit: does each read as what it is? (Devices move: owner present.)
12. **Feel session.** `python tools\haptics\design\report.py` open on a second screen; edit one effects\*.json at a time while
    `haptics.ps1 live --live` runs (hot reload), two laps per change.
