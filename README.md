# i76-everywhere

**Interstate '76 (GOG Gold, 1997) running well on everything: Apple Silicon Macs, Steam Deck,
and modern Windows — plus a full save editor and the reverse-engineered file formats.**

This repo ships **no copyrighted game files**. You bring your own GOG copy; everything here is
scripts, source, and documentation. Downloaded/copyrighted material lives in a local, gitignored
`game-data/` folder.

## Start here

| You want to… | Go to |
|---|---|
| **Play on a Mac** (Apple Silicon) | [docs/MAC-BUILD.md](docs/MAC-BUILD.md) — the shipping build: software renderer via DxWnd in a self-contained Wine wrapper. Instant start, music, clean quit, 20 FPS physics-safe |
| **Play on a Steam Deck** | [docs/STEAMDECK.md](docs/STEAMDECK.md) — the pretty Glide path (dgVoodoo→Vulkan) + force feedback |
| **Play on Windows** | [docs/WINDOWS-PLAYBOOK.md](docs/WINDOWS-PLAYBOOK.md) — max graphics, FFB, frame-gen |
| **Edit your saves** (no install) | **[Open the save editor in your browser →](https://therealjkvalentine.github.io/i76-everywhere/i76-save-editor.html)** — drag a save in, download it back out. Details: [the save editor](#the-save-editor) |
| **Understand the file formats** | [i76-save-editor.py](i76-save-editor.py) docstring (save format) + [docs/HD-TEXTURES-RESEARCH.md](docs/HD-TEXTURES-RESEARCH.md) (ZFS/VQM/M16) |
| **Know what's already settled** | [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — the doc map: what works, what's a parked dead end. **Read before re-chasing anything** |
| **Every fix, one table** | [docs/VERIFIED-FIXES.md](docs/VERIFIED-FIXES.md) — symptom → root cause → fix, all verified in play |

## The save editor

A single self-contained web page styled after the game's garage paperwork.
**Zero-install:** [use it right now in any browser](https://therealjkvalentine.github.io/i76-everywhere/i76-save-editor.html)
— drag a save file in, edit, download it back out (nothing is uploaded; it all runs locally in the page).

- `./i76-save-editor.command` (Mac) — opens the editor with your saves auto-loaded and
  **writes edits straight back** (timestamped backups on every write; deletes are recoverable)
- `i76-save-editor.html` — the same page anywhere (Windows/Deck browser): drag saves in,
  download edits out
- `i76-save-editor.py` — the same parser as a terminal tool

What it edits: equipped parts (any weapon on any mount — off-spec swaps clearly marked),
armor (the DEFENSE panel numbers), every part's location (car/van/repair), condition, part
swaps with **measured DPS + range** on every weapon (data: Local Ditch), scene selection
("Scene № on a diner check"), save-as-slot, delete/restore. The save format was
reverse-engineered in this repo — details in the `.py` docstring.

## Highlights under the hood

- **Cutscene-music fix** ([smack-music-fix/](smack-music-fix/)): a proxy `SMACKW32.DLL` that
  recreates the 1997 CD-drive behavior (music stops when a movie starts) — fixes a GOG bug
  the community called unfixable. Ordinal-exact export forwarding; works on Mac and Windows.
- **Exactly-20 FPS physics** everywhere (the engine ties physics to framerate; scene 5's
  canyon jump is impossible above it): DxWnd delay on Mac, dgVoodoo `FPSLimit` on Deck/Windows.
- **HD texture pipeline** ([texture-lab/](texture-lab/)): the VQM/M16 texture formats cracked,
  with round-trip encoders.
- **The Voodoo path** (Glide→dgVoodoo→DXVK→MoltenVK→Metal) works but is **parked on Mac** —
  MoltenVK can't persist compiled pipelines. [docs/VOODOO-PARKED.md](docs/VOODOO-PARKED.md)
  has the exact announcement that would revive it.
