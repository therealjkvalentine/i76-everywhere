# Frame generation (Lossless Scaling), optional. The engine's physics are locked

# smoother picture is interpolating display frames on top - which is exactly what
# LSFG does. VERIFIED 2026-08-01: Lossless Scaling has NO Steam dependency -
# launched directly it loads zero steam_api/steamclient/overlay modules and
# nothing from outside its own folder, so Steam never has to be running.
# The "Interstate '76 Gold Edition" profile in
# %LOCALAPPDATA%\Lossless Scaling\Settings.xml has AutoScale=true + a 2x fixed
# multiplier, so it engages on its own when the game window appears - no hotkey.
